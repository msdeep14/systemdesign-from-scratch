# Execution Log - v0

## Phase: Setup Slow Upload Scenario
*   **Analysis:** Based on the scenario of showcasing Gunicorn's synchronous workers getting blocked by slow client uploads, we set up `simulate_slow_upload.py` and `test_responsiveness.py` to replicate the problem.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Cleaned up old documentation files from `skills/` directory (kept `SKILLS.md`).
    *   Updated `SKILLS.md` to reference `chapter01` for the initial architecture.
    *   Created `simulate_slow_upload.py` to send photo data extremely slowly.
    *   Created `test_responsiveness.py` to test basic API responsiveness.
*   **Notes/Edge Cases:** None encountered yet.
